# Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Predictor

This project uses sentiment analysis on financial news or social media to predict short-term stock price movements. It combines natural language processing (NLP), financial data analysis, and machine learning to explore whether sentiment signals can help anticipate market behavior.

---

## Project Goals

- Collect and clean financial news or tweet data for specific stock tickers (e.g., TSLA, AAPL)
- Perform sentiment analysis using VADER and/or FinBERT
- Merge sentiment with historical stock price data
- Train machine learning models to predict next-day price movement
- Evaluate the predictive power of sentiment using backtesting
- (Optional) Visualize results with a Streamlit dashboard

## Techniques & Tools

- **Python**, **Pandas**, **yfinance**, **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**
- **NLP**: VADER, FinBERT (HuggingFace Transformers)
- **APIs**: NewsAPI, Tweepy (optional)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Dashboard (optional)**: Streamlit or Dash
